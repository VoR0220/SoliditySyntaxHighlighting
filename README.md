# SoliditySyntaxHighlighting 
Syntax highlighting for the Solidity Programming Language in Sublime Text 2/3

# A note: 

This is a more up to date syntax highlighting scheme than the other Ethereum Syntax Highlighting that is for people who want more colors than Monokai has to offer (it still works fairly well even with Monokai), I have also organized the syntax in a way that I think will enable better contributions, if you want to help out, send me a PR or an issue and I will try to get to it.
