# SoliditySyntaxHighlighting

# A note: 

This is a more up to date syntax highlighting scheme that is for people who want more colors than Monokai has to offer (it still works fairly well even with Monokai), I have also organized the syntax in a way that I think will enable better contributions, if you want to help out, send me a PR or an issue and I will try to get to it. 

# Installation: 

use Package Control
